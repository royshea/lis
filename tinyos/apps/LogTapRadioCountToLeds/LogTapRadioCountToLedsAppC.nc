/**
 * Configuration for the RadioCountToLeds application. RadioCountToLeds
 * maintains a 4Hz counter, broadcasting its value in an AM packet
 * every time it gets updated. A RadioCountToLeds node that hears a counter
 * displays the bottom three bits on its LEDs. This application is a useful
 * test to show that basic AM communication and timers work.

 * Extended to demonstrate the LogTap framework.  This requires:
 * - Adding the LogTapC component and wiring boot into it.
 * - Extending the makefile to pull in the LogTap NesC component
