Log Instrumentation Specifications (LIS)
=======================================

Overview
--------

[NOTE]
=========

This documentation is a work in progress (June 2009).  Two
tarballs are available while this document is under construction.  The
first is a copy of LIS that has full TinyOS integration.  The second is
a tarball of just the LIS core for use on desktop systems.

What is LIS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The log instrumentation specification (LIS) language provides a simple
and powerful means to describe data you want to gather from a system at
runtime.

Users can quickly write a LIS script to accomplish basic logging tasks.
Higher level analyses that provide specialized logging functionality
also use LIS as an intermediate language to direct insertion of logs
into a code base.

LIS is optimized to provide logs using minimal system resources, ranging
from log bandwidth minimization to occupying a small runtime footprint.
This makes LIS a great tool for diagnosing problems and exploring
runtime behavior in resource constrained embedded systems.

LIS does not allow completely free form logging.  Rather, it logs a
stream of markers triggered when a program passes a point of interest
described in a LIS script and potentially a variable value (for watch
points).  This restricted logging framework helps users to formalize
their logging tasks and makes for a lean instrumentation engine and
runtime.


Why use LIS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Unlike +printf+ and similar logging systems that require manual system
instrumentation, the LIS script is used at compile time to automate
instrumentation of a code base.  This saves programmer time and effort,
prevents copy and paste errors common to manual log insertion, and makes
it trivial to remove logging after a problem or question has been
resolved.

In some execution domains traditional debugging methods are unwieldy or
simply unavailable.  For example, physical access to a deployed wireless
embedded device often inhibits the use of JTAG or delays caused by
interactive debuggers can mask and create new runtime errors in systems
of interacting devices.

LIS has been used to debug programs and look deeply into the runtime
behavior of both desktop and embedded systems.  It has been used to
examine:

* Standard C programs running on x86 processors

* Distributed embedded software running on the ATMega128  processor

* Distributed embedded software running on the MSP430 processor


What do I need to use LIS?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LIS framework is designed to instrument C programs.  Other
languages, such as nesC, that compile to C at an intermediate step can
also be handled by the LIS framework.  LIS depends on the following
additional tools:

* http://manju.cs.berkeley.edu/cil/[CIL] which is built using
http://caml.inria.fr/[OCaml] to instrument the programs

* http://www.python.org/doc/[Python] for log parsing and used by some of
the analyses in the distribution that use LIS as an intermediary
language

* The actual LIS distribution is available as a tarball or (for the
latest and greatest) via http://git-scm.com/[git]

* Good 'ol ANSI C for runtime logging support and compiling C programs



Integration into TinyOS
-----------------------

LIS was specifically developed for collecting data from resource
constrained wireless embedded systems.  We have provided full
integration with the TinyOS 2.x operating system.  This support
provides:

* Build integration via a new "lis" option as an add-on to the mica2,
micaZ and TelosB targets

* Low overhead +bitlog+ runtime library providing basic logging support

* Multi-hop log delivery using the
http://www.tinyos.net/tinyos-2.1.0/doc/html/tep123.html[collection tree
protocol]

* Single-hop log delivery using the +AMSend+ interface

The following installation script will download a clean version of
TinyOS and integrate LIS support into it.

link:install/tos_install.sh[TinyOS Installation Script]

The installation script takes as input a base directory describing where
you installed LIS and a base directory where you want to install TinyOS.

----
wget http://projects.nesl.ucla.edu/~roy/lis/install/tos_install.sh
sh tos_install.sh $HOME/local/ $HOME/local
----

The TinyOS support can be accessed via one of two modes: directly via
LIS scripts or using a higher level analysis that implements optimized
call trace generation.

----
# Move into demo directory
cd apps/MultihopLogTapRadioCountToLeds

# Generate image instrumented based on the "health_no_crc.lis" script
LIS_FILE=health_no_crc.lis make telosb lis

# Generate image that gathers call traces through the LedsP and
# CtpRoutingEngineP TinyOS components.
LOG_PREFIX="LedsP CtpRoutingEngineP" make telosb lowlog
