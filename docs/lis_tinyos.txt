LIS and TinyOS
==============

Integration into TinyOS
-----------------------

LIS was specifically developed for collecting data from resource
constrained wireless embedded systems.  We have provided full
integration with the TinyOS 2.x operating system.  This support
provides:

* Build integration via a new "lis" option as an add-on to the mica2,
  micaZ, and TelosB targets
* Low overhead +bitlog+ runtime library providing basic logging support
* Multi-hop log delivery using the
  http://www.tinyos.net/tinyos-2.1.0/doc/html/tep123.html[collection
  tree protocol]
* Single-hop log delivery using the +AMSend+ interface

The TinyOS support can be accessed via one of two modes: directly via
LIS scripts or using a higher level analysis that implements optimized
call trace generation.

----
# Move into demo directory
cd apps/MultihopLogTapRadioCountToLeds

# Generate image instrumented based on the "health_no_crc.lis" script
LIS_FILE=health_no_crc.lis make telosb lis

# Generate image that gathers call traces through the LedsP and
# CtpRoutingEngineP TinyOS components.
LOG_PREFIX="LedsP CtpRoutingEngineP" make telosb lowlog

Please email mailto:royshea@gmail.com[Roy Shea] for access to
installation scripts and access to the TinyOS patches used to integrate
LIS with TinyOS.

// The following installation script will download a clean version of
// TinyOS and integrate LIS support into it.
//
// TODO: link:install/tos_install.sh[TinyOS Installation Script]
//
//
// The installation script takes as input a base directory describing where
// you installed LIS and a base directory where you want to install TinyOS.
