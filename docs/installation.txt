Installing LIS
==============

Prerequisites
-------------

These installation instructions assume a system with a basic build
system for C and Ocaml.

// For Ubuntu Linux distributions, this can be accomplished using:
//
// ----
// sudo apt-get install TODO
// ----

Installation Script
-------------------

Installation is automated using the following installation script:

link:code/install.sh[LIS Installation Script]

The script requires that OCaml already be installed on the system.  The
script automates:

* Downloading CIL

* Downloading LIS

* Building CIL

* Building LIS

The installation script takes as input the directory where you want LIS
to be installed.  For example:

----
wget http://projects.nesl.ucla.edu/~rshea/lis/code/install.sh
sh install.sh $HOME/lis-core
----

This will create the +lis-core+ directory that includes a full CIL
installation and the LIS framework.  If you run into any problems with
the installation script please email mailto:royshea@gmail.com[Roy Shea].

After installing LIS it is good to look over the
link:tutorial/index.html[tutorial] and link:manual/index.html[user
manual.]

Manual Installation
-------------------

These instructions assume you are working from the +$LISDIR+
directory.  You can set this environment variable in bash using:

----
export LISDIR=/$HOME/lis-core
----

Obtain LIS and CIL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Download the current version of LIS and the 1.3.6 version of CIL to
the +$LISDIR+ directory.

* link:lis-core.tgz[code/lis-core.tgz]
* http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/cil/cil/cil-1.3.7/cil-1.3.7.tar.gz[cil-1.3.7.tar.tgz]


Build CIL
~~~~~~~~~

Build CIL for the native system running on your computer.

----
cd $LISDIR
tar -xzvf cil-1.3.7.tar.gz
cd cil-1.3.7
autoconf && ./configure && make
cd $LISDIR
----

Note that by using the +CIL_MACHINE+, is described in
link:lis_tos.html[LIS and TinyOS] documentation, this version of CIL can
target a wide range of processors including the AVR and MSP430 embedded
processors.


Build LIS
~~~~~~~~~

The LIS core handles instrumentation of C based source code.  This core
uses CIL (built above) to help parse and instrument C.

----
CILPATH=$LISDIR/cil-1.3.7 make -C $LISDIR/lis
make -C $LISDIR/bitlog
----

After installing LIS it is good to look over the
link:tutorial/index.html[tutorial] and link:manual/index.html[user
manual.]
